When the application is ran, itll go through the questions asking for inputs that populate the doucment such as: What is the title of the application, what is the suggested installation instructions, did you have any collaborators, what license applies to your application, etc. when a license is selected from the list, the correcsponding badge will generate at the top of the ReadMe as well.
